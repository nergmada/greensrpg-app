<Primitive>
    <p>When you perform a special ability, it usually consumes points from one of your pools. Edge provides a discount.</p>
    <p>Because your character may be naturally strong, or smart, or agile, they don't need to use as many points as everyone else.</p>
    <p>If a given action takes 3 Might Points and you have a might edge of 1, you really only need to pay two points.</p>
