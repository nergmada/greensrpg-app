        "description": "The 100th Street Bubble is a weather defense project developed by a number of private companies and individuals. The project aimed to create a protective bubble from the worst effects of hypercanes on New York City. Because the bubble only defended a section of the island of Manhattan, prices - both rental and purchase - for accommodation skyrocketed. A later CBC investigation would uncover that the bubble itself in fact exacerbated hypercane effects on parts of the city not encompassed by its weather defense system.\n\nThe subsequent increased devastation inevitably drove more New York residents inland and north to Canada."

Hurricane Enola, made landfall along the US Eastern seabord in 2026, causing devastation along the east coast. At the time, the Hypercane was described as a once in a millennia event. As extreme weather events became more frequent, so too did Hypercanes."

The purpose of the cannon, to deliver a pulse charge to developing Hypercane weatherfronts, before the make landfall and cause devastation. The cannon began construction in October 2058, on the site of Toronto's Casa Loma. \n\nTheorised 12 years earlier, scientists initially had concerns with regards to targeting it, and the immense amount of computational power involved. Following investment from Megagol and Meta - both interested in seeing New York City's hypercane problem dealt with - these computational hurdles were somehow overcome."

As a result, many NY residents migrated north, seeking new opportunities in Canada, but have been forced into camps on the US-Canadian border in an effort to control the massive influx."
